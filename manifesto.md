This is the OpenGovTech Manifesto:

<section class="manifesto" markdown="1">
No-one owns this manifesto. Anyone with an interest in OpenGovTech can update it, so go for it.

Sharing:
It is good to copy.
Sharing is the way to make local gov more efficient.
Stand on the shoulders of giants.
We value shared building blocks more than full solutions.

Make it open, make it better:
OpenGovTech is not free, its better.
You cannot steal what is open.
You can't and won't sell or make money from OpenGovTech.

For the people, by the people.
Communicate well, widely, openly.
Don't create your own central asset hoards, widely signpost and reuse others' assets.
Tech is the enabler, not the solution.

During the
[initial conversation](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/opengovtech-launch-at-wuthering-bytes-tickets-65095735096#)
, we
[brainstormed ideas](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DIFNjkg5xyfw36g7VAF_pY8SZAFWnCWcITw4cb6lQSQ/edit?usp=sharing)
that we believe should define OpenGovTech.
  
This is a very early view from a small subsection of the community,
and needs much more wider input and scrutiny.
