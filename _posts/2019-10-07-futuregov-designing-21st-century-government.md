ODI Leeds attended the FutureGov hosted Designing 21st Century Government event in Manchester on Monday 7th October.

We took the opportunity to speak to the attendees about OpenGovTech in the form of a lightning talk and a table discussion.

The lightning talk showed some examples of OpenGovTech that weâ€™ve been working on. It also proposed that adoption of this open way of working enables more time to be spent on the stuff which makes a difference to the service users (without ignoring the technology and data stuff).

The discussion asked the following questions:

1. Who are the key people to get involved?
2. What are sorts of things that should be shared?
3. What will stop this delivering value to the stakeholders?
4. What is the best way to get this out there?

Our belief is that Stories (story blog), Know How (technique blog) and Assets (catalogue) are the three key mechanisms.
