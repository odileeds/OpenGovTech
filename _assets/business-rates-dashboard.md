summary: Visualisation of Business Rates by Council area
---

ODI Leeds we are exploring local council Business Rates data as part of their Open Data Collaboration group.
They've defined a common format for sharing Business Rates data. Once Local Authorities use that format the data
can be added to the visualisation. There is also a league table page. Click on a Local Authority below to load
their data.
