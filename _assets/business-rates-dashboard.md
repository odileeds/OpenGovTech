summary: Visualisation of Business Rates by Council area
---
ODI Leeds are exploring local council Business Rates data as part of their Open Data Collaboration group.
They've defined a common format for sharing Business Rates data. Once Local Authorities publish using that format the data
can be added to the visualisation. There is also a league table page.
